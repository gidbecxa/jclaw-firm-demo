                      incredibly serious case in which (up until September 2014)
                      could have put me in prison for my ENTIRE LIFE without the
                      possibility of parole. My case was one for the textbooks,
                      a wrongful accusation of a heinous and violent crime that
                      I had nothing to do with, simply in the wrong place, at
                      the wrong time, with the wrong person. I am a UC Berkeley
                      Graduate and ordained pastor whose integrity and freedom
                      was put on trial (literally) for many years. Over this
                      three and a half year process,”

                      ITS DIFFERENT. Jonah chew is the truth. A relate-able guy

                      that could of put me in jail for for a longtime, I was
                      faced with 8 different charges all were felonies. I knew
                      that some of the charges were just bogus and didn't even
                      pertain to me so I wanted to fight it and I didn't trust

                </h5>
                <p>
                  Jonah Chew has more than two decades of experience in the
                  courtroom, earning a reputation as one of San Francisco’s most
                  aggressive and effective criminal litigators. His work and
                  expertise in a wide range of criminal cases has earned him
                  media coverage in numerous Bay Area publications. After
                  receiving his Juris Doctorate from the University of San
                  Francisco School of Law in 1998 and being admitted to the
                  California State Bar the same year, he started a private

                    >criminal practice</a
                  >. Three years later, he was hired at the San Francisco Public
                  Defender’s Office, considered among the best public defender
                  offices in the nation. It was there that Jonah sharpened his
                  skills as a top-notchtrial attorney, representing thousands of
                  clients, writing and arguing hundreds of motions and
                  successfully defending people in cases ranging from simple
                  drug possession to serious
                  <a

                    >felonies</a
                  >. Whether he is defending clients in federal court or in
                  state court, Jonah is a trial attorney who consistently
                  obtains outstanding results. He is aggressive and negotiates
                  the best deals for his clients and guides them towards
                  treatment and rehabilitation when necessary. He is an expert
                  in dealing with complex criminal issues and assists his
                  clients in navigating through the intricacies of the legal
                  system.

                  Jonah’s track record for getting not guilty verdicts and
                  negotiating favorable plea agreements, has saved countless
                  clients from prison, restored their job and educational
                  opportunities and afforded their families the opportunity to

                      incredibly serious case in which (up until September 2014)
                      could have put me in prison for my ENTIRE LIFE without the
                      possibility of parole. My case was one for the textbooks,
                      a wrongful accusation of a heinous and violent crime that
                      I had nothing to do with, simply in the wrong place, at
                      the wrong time, with the wrong person. I am a UC Berkeley
                      Graduate and ordained pastor whose integrity and freedom
                      was put on trial (literally) for many years. Over this
                      three and a half year process,”

                      faced with 8 different charges all were felonies. I knew
                      that some of the charges were just bogus and didn't even
                      pertain to me so I wanted to fight it and I didn't trust

                      “To me, Jonah represents a standard that all in our
                      practice should pursue. He is detail oriented,
                      knowledgeable on the law and all aspects of his case (and
                      if you need him, your case too). Simply stated, Jonah is a
                      true asset to this profession and more importantly his
                      clients in his relentless pursuit of justice for them. I
                      unequivocally endorse Jonah Chew.”
